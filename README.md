# MIXXX2Rekordbox
This is a small Python script that exports a MIXXX Library (From the SQLite DB) to an XML File that can be imported in Rekordbox

It is intended for Djays that use MIXXX as their main Djaying tool at home and want a quick and simple way to export their Library (including hotcues, Colorcoding, Playlists and Crates) to Pioneer Rekordbox so they can take all their work from MIXXX to the big stage and use it in Clubs and Venues on Pioneer Equipment.
