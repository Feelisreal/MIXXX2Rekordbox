# MIXXX2Rekordbox


**Please Backup any important librarys before using (e.g. the Rekordbox Library and the MIXXX Library) as there is absolutely no warranty that this script works. It might mess up your library information on either side (allthough on the MIXXX side it actually just queries the DB, but better save then sorry)**

This is a small Python script that exports a MIXXX Library (From the SQLite DB) to an XML File that can be imported in Rekordbox

It is intended for Djays that use MIXXX as their main Djaying tool at home and want a quick and simple way to export their Library (including hotcues, Colorcoding, Playlists and Crates) to Pioneer Rekordbox so they can take all their work from MIXXX to the big stage and use it in Clubs and Venues on Pioneer Equipment.

With Python installed simply change the path to the SQLite Database in the extract_to_xml.py and execute it. This will generate an output.xml in the same folder that can be imported to recordbox.
